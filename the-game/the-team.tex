\section{The Team} \label{the-team}
Each team consists of 7 characters, each with five stats:

\begin{description}
    \item[Strength (Str)] Strength determines your attack power, and your ability to keep your balance if your attack fails.
    \item[Dexterity (Dex)] Dexterity determines how well you throw and catch the flag.
    \item[Throw (Thr)] Throw is your actual throwing distance. It is $Dex/2$ by default.
    \item[Agility (Agi)] Agility determines how well you dodge and run.
    \item[Move (Mov)] Move is the actual running distance. It is $Agi / 2$ by default.
\end{description}
Each character can also have zero or more special abilities. 
These abilities are additional modifiers that can change up how characters act. 
An example ability could be giving an attacking opponent a smaller chance of succeeding, or being able to leap great distances.
