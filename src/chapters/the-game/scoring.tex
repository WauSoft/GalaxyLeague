\section{Scoring} \label{scoring}
Capturing a flag requires moving it into a capture zone and holding it there until the end of the Third.
Once a Third is over, all the flags in each capture zone are counted, and points are awarded to each player accordingly.
This means, if a player's flag was not stolen during the Third, or was stolen and returned, it counts as one point.
Thus, the least amount you can be rewarded is 0 points, and the most is 6 points.

\begin{note}
    Any flag can be stolen from capture zones by opposing players, including ones that do not belong to you!
\end{note}

\subsection{Zach's Rule}
Throwing a flag off the edge---intentionally or otherwise---deducts one point from the team that threw it.
This has the potential of bringing a team's score down below zero.

\begin{note}
    If a player holding the flag or ball is moved over the edge of the board by successfully being Shoved or by failing a Harm, the flag or ball may also go over the edge either during the fumble or clutched in the hands of the player who was sent over.
    In either case, Zach's rule does not apply and none of the teams involved lose any points for this.
    The flag or ball and player are removed from the game as normal.
