\subsection{Making Alliances}
In a three-team game, nothing prevents two coaches from forming a temporary alliance to gang up on the third coach.
What the conditions of these alliances entail, how long they last, and whether or not they involve double-crossing is up to the individual coaches.

Players on teams that are allied treat each-other as \textit{friendly} unless otherwise declared by the relevant coach.
This declaration may happen at any time.
