\section{The Team} \label{the-team}
Each team consists of 7 players, each with four stats:

\begin{description}
    \item[Fight (Fgt)] Fight determines your character's attack power, and determines how well they hold up in direct combat.
    \item[Flight (Flt)] Flight determines how well your character dodges and runs.
    \item[Throw (Thr)] Throw is your character's throwing distance.
    \item[Move (Mov)] Move is your character's running distance.
\end{description}

\fight{} and \flight{} typically have values ranging between 1 and 6.

\subsection{Special Abilities}
Each character can also have zero or more special abilities.
These abilities are additional modifiers that can change up how characters act.
An example ability could be giving an attacking opponent a smaller chance of succeeding, or being able to leap great distances.
These special abilities are often implemented using \textit{Source} (see Section~\ref{energy}).
