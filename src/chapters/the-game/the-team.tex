\section{The Team} \label{the-team}
Each team consists of around 7 players, each with four basic attributes:

\begin{description}
    \item[\strength{} (\str{})] \strength{} determines your player's attack power, and determines how well they hold up in direct combat.
    \item[\agility{} (\agi{})] \agility{} determines how well your player dodges and runs.
    \item[Throw (Thr)] Throw is your player's throwing distance.
    \item[Move (Mov)] Move is your player's running distance.
\end{description}

\strength{} and \agility{} typically have values ranging between 1 and 6.

\subsection{Special Abilities}
Each player can also have zero or more special abilities.
These abilities are additional modifiers that can change up how players act.
An example ability could be giving an attacking opponent a smaller chance of succeeding, or being able to leap great distances.

The special ability will be noted on the player card with a name, zero or more suits that activate it, and the skill it pertains to.

\begin{example}
    $\heartsuit$ \textbf{Sure Shot (Throw)}\\
    This skill activates when a heart is drawn when performing a throw check.
\end{example}
