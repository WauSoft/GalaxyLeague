\section{The Team} \label{the-team}
Each team consists of around 7 players, each with four basic attributes:

\begin{description}
    \item[\fight{} (\fgt{})] \fight{} determines your player's attack power, and determines how well they hold up in direct combat.
    \item[\flight{} (\flt{})] \flight{} determines how well your player dodges and runs.
    \item[Throw (Thr)] Throw is your player's throwing distance.
    \item[Move (Mov)] Move is your player's running distance.
\end{description}

\fight{} and \flight{} typically have values ranging between 1 and 6.

% \subsection{Special Abilities}
% Each player can also have zero or more special abilities.
% These abilities are additional modifiers that can change up how players act.
% An example ability could be giving an attacking opponent a smaller chance of succeeding, or being able to leap great distances.
% These special abilities are often implemented using \textit{Source} (see \secref{energy}).
