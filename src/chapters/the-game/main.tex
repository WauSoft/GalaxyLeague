\section{Basic Gameplay} \label{basic-gameplay}
The objective of the game is to score the most points by capturing the opponents' flags while keeping your own safe.
A game is broken down in the following way:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A game consists of three acts, called Thirds.
    These work similar to half-times in most sports.
    % TODO: Find a way to possibly automate this
    \item The game starts with rock-paper-scissors, dice roll, or other means to determine who goes first.
    % TODO: introduce a play-book mechanic
    \item Each player starts a Third by positioning their units on their side of the board.
    Positioning units goes clockwise around the board, starting with the first player.
    \item Once a player is done positioning their units, they may not try and reposition them in response to the placement of the other teams’ units.
    \item A character can do one of five things on its turn:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Do nothing.
        \item Move a number of hexes less than or equal to their move score.
        \item Attack an opponent (see Section \ref{attacking}).
        \item Throw or Pass a flag (see Section \ref{flag-interaction})
        \item A special action, which may require Source (see Section \ref{energy}).
    \end{enumerate}
    \item A flag is picked up automatically upon touching, unless it’s either thrown at you or rolling towards you (see Section \ref{flag-interaction}).
    \item Bringing a flag does not automatically end a Third unless either
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item All three flags are in the same capture zone
        \item The Heavy is captured
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
