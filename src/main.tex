\section*{Premise}
Flag-Ball is a rugby/capture-the-flag hybrid tabletop game for three players.
Each player has a flag to protect, and a team of characters.
The game is played on a hex-grid, with three of the sides acting as each team's capture zone.

    \label{fig:court}
\end{figure}
Depicted on \figref{fig:court} is a mock-up of the playing field.
The three coloured edges are the capture zones.
The darker hexes in each capture zone, is where that team's flag is placed at the start of the game.
The dark hex in the middle is where the ball is placed.
The white lines mark the different teams' starting zones.
The middle zone is a buffer zone where players canâ€™t position their units at the start of the game.

\begin{note}
    From this point onward the people playing the game will be referred to as \textit{coaches} and the figures on the board as \textit{players}.
