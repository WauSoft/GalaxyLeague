\chapter{Concepts and Terminology}
Before we begin, it is important to establish some terminology, which will form a through-line through the rulebook.

\begin{description}
\item[Action] One of the things you can do in a turn.
\item[Action Point (AP)] Something you spend to perform actions. Once out of AP, no more actions can be performed on your turn.
\item[Act] One part of the game. The game is divided into three acts. At the end of the third act, the coach with the most points wins the game.
\item[Coach] You, the person playing the game.
\item[Player] A player is one of the movable models.
The players have different stats as outlined by the Teams chapter.
\item[Field] The main play area of the game board. The field is lined with hexes, lines, and numbers. The numbers are purely Ã¦sthetic to evoke the idea of football pitch yard lines.
\item[Capture Zone] Each team has a capture zone.
The capture zone is where the flags and ball are brought in order to score points for a round.
\item[Destiny Deck] A standard 52 card deck + 2 Jokers
\item[Skill Check] Comparing a player's skill and drawing a \destiny{} card.
\item[Degree of Success] By \textit{how much} the skill check succeeded. If the skill is ``7+'' and the drawn card was a 10, then the skill succeeded by three degrees. 
\item[Team] Your personal selection of player models.
