\chapter{Concepts and Terminology}
Before we begin, it is important to establish some terminology, which will form a through-line through the rulebook.

\begin{description}
\item[Action] One of the things you can do in a turn.
\item[Action Point (AP)] Something you spend to perform actions. Once out of AP, no more actions can be performed on your turn.
\item[Act] One part of the game. The game is divided into three acts. At the end of the third act, the coach with the most points wins the game.
\item[Coach] You, the person playing the game.
\item[Player] A player is one of the movable models.
The players have different stats as outlined by the Teams chapter.
\item[Field] The main play area of the game board. The field is lined with hexes, lines, and numbers. The numbers are purely Ã¦sthetic to evoke the idea of football pitch yard lines.
\item[Capture Zone] Each team has a capture zone.
The capture zone is where the flags and ball are brought in order to score points for a round.
\item[Fate Die] A die which has \plus{}, \minus{}, and \blank{} on its faces rather than pips/numbers.
In most instances, this will be treated as a $\pm 1$ or a 0 for stats.
\item[dF] Dice notation for a \textit{Fate Die}. 
$3dF$ refers to rolling 3 \fate{} dice, $2dF+1$ means ``roll two \fate{} dice and add 1 to the result''
\item[Skill Check] Comparing a player's skill and rolling a \fate{} die.
\item[Scatter Die] A scatter die is a die with four arrows and two hits on it. When rolled, the arrows randomly choose a direction, but there's also a chance to hit.
\item[Team] Your personal selection of player models.
