# Rebalancing From 0.2.0 to 1.0.0

## Areas that need tackling

A lot of the systems are overly complicated and need reworking.

1. A Change of Setting
2. Fix Skills & Attacks
3. Fix the _Source_ System
4. Rework Throwing Fails

## A Change of Setting

The setting of "Generic sport played in a galaxy-spanning league" doesn't really make any sense.

I feel it makes more sense to have it take place in the [Curse of Transience](https://github.com/ElectricCoffee/Curse-of-Transience) universe instead; thus leveraging the nations, races, and other fantastical aspects of the setting, such as the impermanence of death.

This also helps further flesh out the setting, as the game will be an in-universe sport.

### Changing the Name

With the change in setting, it's natural to also change the name.

As of yet, the working name is _Flag-Ball_.

## Fix Skills and Attacks

The current system of using two separate sets of dice and complex rules for how these interact.

This can and should be drastically simplified.

The current running idea (ha, running), simplifies this to just one set of dice.

## Fix the _Source_ System

Having several types of source (mana) doesn't really make much sense as it creates scenarios where nobody has the correct type of source will inevitably slow the game down and be un-fun for all players.

Instead the source will be of only one type, and will increase over time.

## Rework Throwing Fails

Throwing Fails require an entire page worth of text to accurately describe what exactly can or will happen if someone were to fumble their throw.

This needs to be simplified, so players aren't bogged down with this phase of the game.

## Playtesting Notes 2020-09-09

### Order of actions matters

As long as a character is 'producing a zone', they can aid. Unless that character failed an aid prior.

The following are allowed

- Move -> Act
- Act -> Move

But you cannot Move -> Act -> Move

Dodging does not count as an action, as long as they succeed.

### ~~Heavy always just ends the round~~

Additionally, it is worth no points at all.

### Helping is not an action, unless it fails

### You have to decide who attacks/tackles whom

This is to facilitate helping as not being an action

1. Attacker declares type of attack and target
2. Attacker declares helpers
3. Defender declares helpers
4. Harrier declares harrassers
5. Combat resolves en masse
6. Depending on outcome, the coaches may move players accordingly
7. If successful, attacker's helpers are free to act.

### ~~First Coach Disadvantage~~

First coach's flag goes in the centre zone.

Roll 4dF, add all the non-zeroes together as if they were all +'s and add 3 to the result.
The flag is then move that number of hexes in any direction within the centre zone starting from the hex chosen by the first coach.

### Failing/stalemating a dodge uses up an action

So if you've acted already you can't dodge at all
