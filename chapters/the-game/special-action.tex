\section{Special Action} \label{special-action}
There are three special actions a player can perform each turn, each of which can be performed only once per turn: Tackling, Hurling, and Sprinting.
\note{A Special Action \textit{must} be announced before it is performed.}

\subsection{Tackling}
Tackling is a special form of attack. It lets you move before and after attacking an opponent.
\note{This movement still counts towards the characterâ€™s total movement. So if your character has a Move of 6, and you move 4 hexes, then attack someone, then you can only move 2 hexes afterwards.}
\subsection{Hurling}
Hurling is a special form of throwing, it lets you move before and after throwing a flag.
Movement rules apply the same way as for tackling.
\subsection{Sprinting}
Sprinting is an Agility skill roll that lets a character move beyond their normal Move range.
Every two additional hexes worth of movement subtracts 1 point from the total Agility score you need to roll under.
This skill roll happens \textbf{after} you have moved the normal amount of hexes.

\example{Your character's Agility is 10 (Move = 5), and you wish to move 7 hexes. 
You must then roll $\leq 9$ in order to succeed.
If you fail, your character falls on their face on the last hex of the normal move.}
