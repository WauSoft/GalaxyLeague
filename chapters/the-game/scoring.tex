\section{Scoring} \label{scoring}
Capturing a flag requires moving it into a capture zone and holding it there until the end of the Third.
Once a Third is over, all the flags in each capture zone are counted, and points are awarded to each player accordingly.
This means, if a player's flag was not stolen during the Third, or was stolen and returned, it counts as one point.
Thus, the least amount you can be rewarded is 0 points, and the most is 6 points.

\note Any flag can be stolen from capture zones by opposing players, including ones that do not belong to you!

\paragraph{Also Note} Holding a flag within a capture zone does not count it as being captured.
It \textit{must} be on the ground.
